"Nearly Nine" will be published in Volume 2 of _Skullmore_, an art and literary magazine published in Sioux Falls, SD.

When I saw the first volume of _Skullmore_, with its edgy art, quirky prose and punk aesthetics, I knew I had to be a part of it. After some conversations with Marc Wagner (Editor, _Skullmore_), he selected "Nearly Nine" for publication in their second volume.

_Skullmore_ is partly the creation of an artist I worked with at Lawrence & Schiller named Les Cotton. His illustrations and drawings are at once bold, distinctive and captivating. His fingerprints are all over this magazine, and I'm happy to be a contributor.

Volume 2 hits newsstands on XXXX XXth. You can find _Skullmore_ at a number of locations around Sioux Falls, especially downtown, or by checking out their website at [http://skullmoremag.com](http://skullmoremag.com).
