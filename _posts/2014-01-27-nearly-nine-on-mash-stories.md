<a href="http://mashstories.com/previouslypublished/nearly-nine/">"Nearly Nine"</a> is a short story I wrote for a contest on <a href="http://www.mashstories.com">MashStories.com</a>. I was fortunate enough to get short listed. This means my story is up on their website for (literally) dozens of people to read. Make sure you're one of them.

Together we can make this depressing story about a plane crash into a slightly less depressing story about a plane crash because at least those people died for something important.
