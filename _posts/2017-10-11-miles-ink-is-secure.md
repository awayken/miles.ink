You may have noticed a new feature of the website: a shiny, green padlock up in the address bar. We're secure, readers!

<!--more-->

What does this mean for you? Well, nothing much. It means that as you browse and read along, you can feel certain that no one on the Internet is lurking between your web browser and my website. It's maybe a small condolence, since I don't ask for any personal information through my website, but it's nice all the same.

You can learn more about [HTTPS on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a nerd. Otherwise, just smile and nod and keep reading.

A side effect of having a secure site is that I can play with newer web technologies. One such technology that I've implemented is offline browsing support. That's right! In [adequately-enhanced browsers](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/), Miles.ink is now ready to go offline. Did you start a news article but don't have enough time to finish it before your flight? Don't worry! It's already saved in your browser! And the next article is, too! Every news article and every page is available instantly. How lucky are you?
