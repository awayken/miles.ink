Last year I published a story, "Space Cowboy", in [issue 10 of _Speculative66_]({% post_url 2017-07-06-speculative66-issue-10 %}). I enjoyed the creative constraints that the competition puts on the writers, and I very much enjoyed working with [the staff](https://twitter.com/LLMadridWriter). Recently, having come off some major work on a novel, I was eager to dive back into flash fiction to center myself. I discovered a snippet in my "Ideas" Evernotebook and was inspired to write "Stone Son."
