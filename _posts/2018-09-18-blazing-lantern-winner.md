Blazing Lantern announced the results of its 2018 Fiction Prize, and the winner was my novel, <a href="http://www.blazinglantern.com/winner-miles-rausch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Story to Tell</a>. The grand prize is a contract that carries a publisher's advance plus a portion of book royalties.

The <a href="http://www.blazinglantern.com/fiction-prize.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blazing Lantern Fiction Prize</a> was first announced in 2017. It seeks to celebrate American Midwestern authors of unpublished or self-published novels that its judges find exceptional. The contest received over 130 novels, and the judges narrowed that list down to three finalists and one winner. Blazing Lantern will provide book editing, layout, jacket design, cover art, marketing, promotional services and a case of books to the winner. There will also be an Award Presentation Gala for all winners and finalists.

While the prizes have not yet been awarded, I'm absolutely delighted that my novel placed so well. It's not a perfect novel, but it was inspired by the spirit and life of my late Grandma Harriet and will always have a special place in my heart.
