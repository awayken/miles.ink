        <p>What can I write about myself that doesn't sound like every other writer's tired biography? I love to write for humans and computers, so I made a writing website (which is more programming that Hemingway ever did).</p>

        <p>Anyway, what can I put here to encourage you to read my site? "Please read my site?" "Read my site now?" "There's free stuff somewhere on this website?"</p>

        <p>Yeah, maybe that last one.</p>
