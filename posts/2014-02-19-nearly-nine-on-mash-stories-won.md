<a href="http://mashstories.com/nearly-nine/">"Nearly Nine"</a> is a short story I wrote for a contest on <a href="http://www.mashstories.com">MashStories.com</a>. I was fortunate enough to get short listed, and I was even more fortunate to win.

A big thank you, and much credit, has to go to the people who shared, commented, and voted on my story. The feedback was encouraging, and it was fun to hear people's reactions. The win is encouraging for my future creative writing endeavors.

If you're interested, you can read <a href="http://mashstories.com/previouslypublished/nearly-nine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Nearly Nine" on MashStories.com</a>. Second place went to <a href="http://mashstories.com/lost-balls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Lost Balls" by Ross Baxter</a>, and third place was awarded to <a href="http://mashstories.com/tina-trapped-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carrie Guss for "Tina, Trapped and Released"</a>. Excellent stories, all.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to buy $100 worth of hipster writing glasses and typewriters. I've arrived, baby.
