The hook for _Speculative66_ is that stories need to be some sort of speculative fiction, and they have to be exactly 66 words long. Challenge accepted! I wrote "Space Cowboy" for the contest and was elated to get an email that my story had been selected for publication.

You can [read the issue on the Speculative66 Scribd page](https://www.scribd.com/document/353084811/speculative-66-issue-10). My story is on page 17. You can also [read this tweet of Space Cowboy](https://twitter.com/Speculative_66/status/883018397495173120) or see it on my [Read](/read/) page.
