<p>Plenty of my stuff is online for free. Why? Because I'm an idiot, apparently. No, but serious, though, folks: I've been around. Part of trying to get people to publish you is letting other people publish you way out in the open. Read some of my stuff below.</p>

<p>Do you want access to an exclusive ebook of some of my short stories? <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=784219&ty=h" target="_blank">Support me on Patreon</a> and get at least that free ebook as a reward.
