Stone Son

   Lord, deliver me from the soil. Save me from the dirt. Lift me from the banks of Father's river, which never washed me clean.
   Take my seeds away, the ones that feed and the ones that eat. Lead their roots to crystal waters. Lead their hands to salvation.
   Make me hard. To cross onto the concrete, the glass, the steel.
   Make me your stone son, Lord.
