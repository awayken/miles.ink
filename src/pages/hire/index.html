<p>Have a website or print piece that you want a writer's eyes on? Need some marketing copy conjured out of thin air? If you pay me money, I'll do those things for you. I might even do them well.</p>

<p>Below are my starting rates. Rates are subject to change and may be adjusted on a per-project basis. I can give you a full estimate before we start working on a project.</p>

<div class="table table--3cols">
    <div class="table--cell"><h3 class="table--heading">Basic copyediting</h3></div>
    <div class="table--cell">5-10 ms pgs/hr</div>
    <div class="table--cell">$30/hr</div>

    <div class="table--cell is-striped"><h3 class="table--heading">Website copyediting</h3></div>
    <div class="table--cell is-striped">variable</div>
    <div class="table--cell is-striped">$40/hr</div>

    <div class="table--cell"><h3 class="table--heading">Marketing copywriting</h3></div>
    <div class="table--cell">1-3 ms pgs/hr</div>
    <div class="table--cell">$50/hr or 30Â¢/wd</div>
</div>

<p><em>Note: the industry standard for a manuscript page (ms pg) is 250 words.</em></p>
