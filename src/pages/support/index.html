<p>I love to write, and hopefully you love to read. It's hard trying to be a writer with a full time job, a wife, two children and way too much great TV out there. That's why I offer various ways for you to support me. Imagine me as a starving artist, except that I have a fulltime job and eat way too much. Still, I would rather that people pay me for my art some how, some way, some day. (Rhyme.)</p>

<h3 id="email">Through Email</h3>

<p>Would you like to become a Reader of Of Miles Rausch (a RoOMeR)? This is an official designation, not some weird thing I made up. From time to time, I'll be sharing <strong>exclusive and pre-release content</strong> with my RoOMeRs.</p>

<p>The first thing I do for my RoOMeRs is send them <strong>a free ebook</strong>. How does that sound? I'm giving you a free thing that you literally can't get anywhere else. Plus, signing up gives you a chance to <strong>provide feedback</strong> on the things I write, which... might be a minus, actually.</p>

<p>Anyway! Just give me your <del>credit card information</del> email address below!</p>
