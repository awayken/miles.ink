"Nearly Nine" was published in Volume 2 of <i>Skullmore</i>, an art and literary magazine published in Sioux Falls, SD.

When I saw the first volume of <i>Skullmore</i>, with its edgy art, quirky prose and punk aesthetics, I knew I had to be a part of it. After some conversations with Marc Wagner (Editor, <i>Skullmore</i>), he selected "Nearly Nine" for publication in upcoming volume.

<i>Skullmore</i> is partly the creation of an artist I worked with at Lawrence &amp; Schiller named <a href="https://instagram.com/lecotton">Les Cotton</a>. His illustrations and drawings are at once bold, distinctive and captivating. His fingerprints are all over this magazine, and I'm happy to be a contributor.
