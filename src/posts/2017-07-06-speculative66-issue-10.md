"Space Cowboy" was published in Issue 10 of <a href="http://speculative66.weebly.com/"><i>Speculative66</i></a>, a digital literary magazine of speculative flash fiction.

The hook for <i>Speculative66</i> is that stories need to be some sort of speculative fiction, and they have to be exactly 66 words long. Challenge accepted! I wrote "Space Cowboy" for the contest and was elated to get an email that my story had been selected for publication.
