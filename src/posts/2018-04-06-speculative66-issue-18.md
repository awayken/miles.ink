Last year I published a story, "Space Cowboy", in <a href="{% linkToItem 'speculative66-issue-10', collections.news %}">issue 10 of <i>Speculative66</i></a>. I enjoyed the creative constraints that the competition puts on the writers, and I very much enjoyed working with <a href="https://twitter.com/LLMadridWriter">the staff</a>. Recently, having come off some major work on a novel, I was eager to dive back into flash fiction to center myself. I discovered a snippet in my "Ideas" Evernotebook and was inspired to write "Stone Son."
