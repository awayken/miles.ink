I wrote a comic book with my friends, Mikey and Brian, and three issues are available now.

In 2019, Brian Broekemeier approached me about embarking on a new journey. He, along with Mikey Martinez, wanted to start publishing comic books under the moniker <a href="https://empirecomic.press/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Empire Comic Press</a>. He was starting to build a roster of local talent, and he wanted my help in writing one of our first properties: <a href="https://empirecomic.press/robot-dance-club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robot Dance Club</a>.

It was Mikey's concept and character design (and art and inks and covers and etc.), and my job was to take all his brilliance and help craft a story out of it.

So, we began with a simple premise:

   > The robots have won.
   >
   > That terrifying moment when humanity's creations acquired sentience is past.
   >
   > But mankind does not live in fear. The human race is not enslaved, destroyed or wired up like batteries. It is simply ignored.
   >
   > The robots carry on. They build. They destroy. They continue.
   >
   > And, of course, they dance.

We've written three issues so far, and we're hard at work on the fourth. Get your physical or digital copies today from our website: <a href="https://empirecomic.press/robot-dance-club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EmpireComic.press/Robot-Dance-Club</a>.
