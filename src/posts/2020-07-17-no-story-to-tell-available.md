Well, the <a href="http://www.blazinglantern.com/fiction-prize.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blazing Lantern Fiction Prize</a> didn't quite pan out the way I'd hoped. After responding to my initial email asking about the contest and whether I really was the winner (they said I was), they never got back to me with more details. I gave them, oh... two years to write that email. I guess it's a doozy, because they still aren't done.

Well, I'm done. Done waiting for them. Since I have a novel that has a little bit of credibility, I've decided to self-publish it. The process of doing so through Amazon was pretty simple. I use <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scrivener</a> as my writing program, and it can very easily generate files optimized for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b?ie=UTF8&node=154606011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon's Kindle platform</a>. They also offer marketing and pricing tools, although I don't have a lot of experience with those features yet.

I've also added "Novels" to <a href="/read">my Read &amp; Discover page</a>. It lists my available novels along with a summary, purchase links and Goodreads links.

So what are you waiting for? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C36G8PY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy on Amazon (US).</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08C36G8PY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy on Amazon (UK).</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54378332-no-story-to-tell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shelve on Goodreads.</a>
