Previously, "No Story To Tell" was <a href="/news/2020/07/17/no-story-to-tell-available.html">available as an eBook on Amazon</a>. But I've now gone through the process of submitting it for paperback format. It wasn't a terrible amount of work, but it did require generating a new version of the novel's content and creating a new book cover. Having finally accomplished all that in the last few weeks, I submitted the paperback details to Amazon, and they were accepted and published.

It's pretty wild. I can visit the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QG4M76H" title="No Story To Tell by Miles Rausch, available on Amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"No Story To Tell" page on Amazon</a> and see the same kind of links that the books I purchase have available. Is this the Big Time? Sure feels like it!

Anyway... what are you waiting for? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QG4M76H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy on Amazon (US).</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08QG4M76H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy on Amazon (UK).</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54378332-no-story-to-tell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shelve on Goodreads.</a> MAKE ME RICH!!
