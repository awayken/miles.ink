The year 2020 was a very emotional and volatile one for me. One way that I processed all of that change was by rediscovering poetry. I eagerly sought out new poets to read and learn from. I started to stock my shelves with collections. I also began writing poetry like it could save my life, and perhaps it did.

I composed nearly a hundred poems over the course of the year. I started to consider myself a poet. Then one of my favorite bookstores/bars/performance spaces (<a href="https://www.fullcirclebookcoop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full Circle Book Coop</a>), announced they were restarting their Poetry Open Mic Nights. I performed several times, picking the works that reasonated with me the most. After various revisions, layouts and book covers, it eventually became Trinidentium.

It's a very personal and mature collection of poems. It was borne from very difficult times and reflects that genesis. It may not be an enjoyable read. It may be triggering. So&hellip; proceed with caution.

With this new publication, I've also added "Poetry" to <a href="/read">my Read &amp; Discover page</a>. It lists my available collections along with a summary, purchase links and Goodreads links. You know, the standard stuff.
