    I love to write, and hopefully you love to read. It's hard trying to be a writer with a full time job, a wife, two children and way too much great TV out there.

<h3 id="through-patreon">Through Patreon</h3>

<p>I weave beautiful tales from the fabric of imagination and through Patreon you can support said beautiful tale weaving. Patreon lets you, the art ethusiast, become a patron of the artist. You give a certain amount per piece of content created up to a personal maximum. In exchange, the artist gives you access to rewards based on your patronage.</p>
